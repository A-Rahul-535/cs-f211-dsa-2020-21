# CS F211 Data Structures and Algorithms (BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus)
This repository contains the problems, solution approaches & explanations and (for some problems) psueodocode or C code to solve the problem. In general, this repository will be updated with the latest labsheet around 5-7 days after the last lab evaluation on that labsheet is complete. Directories `a0, a1, ...` contain the solutions for the respective labsheets. A README/PDF file will be included in each of these, with the solution explanations for (atleast) some of the problems.
